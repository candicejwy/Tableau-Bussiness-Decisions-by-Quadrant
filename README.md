# Tableau-Bussiness-Decisions-by-Quadrant
This is the dashboard i created. The purpose of this dashboard is to show you which business is the best investment opportunity.
We have 3 factors to make the decision which are The Industry Growth and The Revenue and Expenses on Each Industry.
As you can see,the x-axis the revenue start from lowest to highest. The y-axis is the expenses which range is different from the revenue axis, that is from highest to lowest. So you can see the meaning of each quadrant. Q1 represents High Revenue Low Expenses (Which is the target quadrant). Q2 represents Low Revenue and Low Expenses. Q3 represents Low Revenue High Expense, Q4 Represents High Revenue and High Expenses.
You can change the reference lines here through the parameter to decide how much you want the expenses and revenue to be.For instance, you want your expenses to lower than 4,000 something dollars. And you want your revenue to higher than 8,000 sth dollars. The Growth leader means like here the 11, means the top 11 growth of industries.Among all of the industries, this 11 industries have a higher growth. So from here you can see the first quadrant are the industries which have the High Revenue and Low Expense. And from the top 11 growth of industries, only 8 of them are included in this quadrant.So maybe in the future, you should invest more money on these industries.
