# Tableau-Bussiness-Decisions-by-Quadrant
This is the dashboard I created. The purpose of this dashboard is to show you which business is the best investment opportunity.
![Startup Quadrant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44786518/66241847-069b4000-e6ce-11e9-9225-367cf7366e84.png)

We have 3 factors for making the decision: Industry Growth rank, Revenue, and Expenses for each industry.

As you can see, on the x-axis the revenue starts from zero on the left. The y-axis is the expenses, going from zero from the top. You can see the meaning of each quadrant. Q1 represents High Revenue / Low Expenses (the target quadrant). Q2 represents low revenue and low expenses. Q3 represents low revenue / high expenses, Q4 represents high revenue and high expenses.

You can change the parameters to decide how much you want the expenses and revenue to be. For instance, you want your expenses to be lower than 4,000-something dollars. And you want your revenue to be higher than 8,000-something dollars. The "growth leader" means the top ranking businesses by growth, for example the top 11 growing industries. Among all the industries, these 11 industries have the highest growth. So from here you can see the first quadrant contains the industries which have high revenue and low expenses. And from the top 11 growing industries, only 8 of them are included in this quadrant. So maybe in the future, you may want to invest more money in these industries.
